# Webserver in C
Little proof-of-concept project that can serve files with an HTTP response.

## Getting started
To run this project on your machine, clone the repo and run `make`
Now you can run the server from the `bin` folder, using the following syntax:

```
bin/webserver port [root dir]
```

If not `root dir` is specified, it will serve your current directory.
